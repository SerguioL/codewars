    // It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
    //solution
    function removeChar(str){
        return str.slice(1,-1);
    }

    console.log(removeChar('eloquent'));//loquen
    console.log(removeChar('country'));//ountr
    console.log(removeChar('person'));//erso
    console.log(removeChar('place'));//lac
    console.log(removeChar('ooopsss'));//oopss
